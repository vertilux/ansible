This repository is a collection of ansible playbooks implemented by Vertilux's IT dept to perform some server automations.

** Getting Started
Make sure ansible is installed on your machin, to install ansible:

*** Install ansible on Mac
  ~brew install ansible~

*** Install ansible on Windows
Probably the best option is to installed Ubuntu on WSL (Windows Subsytem for Linux).
  + Search for Windows features in the search box. And when the “Turn Windows features on or off ” appears, click on that.
  + A window will open with a bunch of features. Scroll down and check the box of Windows Subsystem for the Linux option. And after that, click on the OK button.
   [[file:windows-features.png]]
  + Open the Microsoft Store and search for Ubuntu to install the latest version.
   [[file:microsoft-store.png]]
  + After the installation, you will see a launch button, use that to open the Ubuntu bash.
  + On Ubuntu bash, it will ask you to set the username and password for the default user. You can also set the root account password from here by typing ~sudo passwd root~

Now install ansible and press Y when ask for.
#+begin_src bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible
#+end_src

*** Clone the repository.

#+begin_src bash
git clone git@github.com:vertilux/ansible.git
#+end_src

Then cd into the ansible directory: $ ~cd  ansible~

** Deploy
This playbook contains multiples roles to deploy new versions or updates to production.

[[file:infrastructure-diagram.png]]

To avoid password authetication generate a public key and copy to the remote servers.\\
To create the SSH keys, type ~ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"~. This will create both =id_rsa= and =id_rsa.pub= files.
Copy the generated public key to the remote host
#+begin_src bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@remote_host 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
#+end_src

Additioanlly disable password requirement for =sudo=.
Create a file in =/etc/sudoers.d/deploy=
#+begin_src
deploy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
#+end_src

*** Entry point
This playbook execute the different roles that will run

#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook entry_point.yml -i inventory
#+end_src

#+TBLFM:

** Playbooks
A collections o simple playbooks to perform different tasks.

*** Ping
Try to connect to host, verify a usable python and return ~pong~ on success.

#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook ping.yml -i inventory
#+end_src

*** Sidekiq
Background processing for ruby. Sidekiq uses threads to handle jobs at the same time in the same process. It is integrated tightly with Rails to make background processing dead simple.

**** Provision Service
Running sidekiq as a system service with systemd, this will ensure the process is restarted if Sidekiq crashes.
Here is an example systemd file:

#+begin_src
[Unit]
Description=sidekiq
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/home/deploy/APP_LOCATION/current
ExecStart=/home/deploy/.rbenv/shims/bundle exec sidekiq -e ENVIRONMENT
User=deploy
Group=deploy
UMask=0002

# Greatly reduce Ruby memory fragmentation and heap usage
# https://www.mikeperham.com/2018/04/25/taming-rails-memory-bloat/
Environment=MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2

# if we crash, restart
RestartSec=1
Restart=on-failure

# output goes to /var/log/syslog
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog

# This will default to "bundler" if we don't specify it
SyslogIdentifier=sidekiq

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
#+end_src

With the following playbook the service is provision on all servers.

#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook sidekiq_service.yml -K -i inventory.yml
#+end_src

**** Restart Sidekiq

#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook restart-sidekiq.yml -K -i inventory.yml
#+end_src

*** Nginx Webserver
Nginx is a web server that can be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTP cache.

**** Append Nginx Configuration
This playbook will append a configuration block to the default configuration with the env passed. This is the easy way to when deploying a new distribution center.

#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook append-nginx-config.yml -K -i inventory.yml
#+end_src

**** Restart Nginx
Simply restart nginx on all servers excluding load labancer.

#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook restart-nginx.yml -K -i inventory.yml
#+end_src

*** Logrotate
Configuring Logrotate For Rails Production Logs.
Running ~ansible-playbook append-logrotate.yml --extra-vars "env=ENV" -K -i inventory.yml~ will edit ~sudo vim /etc/logrotate.conf~, and at the bottom of the file the following block of code (change the ENV, ex: accltd):

#+begin_src
/home/deploy/erp-ENV/current/log/*.log {
  daily
  missingok
  rotate 7
  compress
  delaycompress
  notifempty
  copytruncate
}
#+end_src

#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook append-logrotate.yml -K -i inventory.yml
#+end_src

*How it works:*
- daily – Rotate the log files each day.
- missingok – If the log file doesn’t exist, ignore it.
- rotate 7 – Only keep 7 days of logs.
- compress – GZip the log file on rotation.
- delaycompress – Rotate the file one day, then compress it the next day so we can be sure that it won’t interfere with the Rails server.
- notifempty – Don’t rotate the file if the logs are empty.
- copytruncate – Copy the log file and then empties it.

*Running Logrotate:*
Then the playbook will run: `sudo /usr/sbin/logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf`

*** Maintenance
Sometimes there is a need to set the ERP Web application into maintenance mode; when an item change needs to be run or when the we need to upgrade Sage. For this scenarios the folloging playbook is the easier way to set all instances in maintenance mode.

Set only one distribution center to maintenance mode.
#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook maintenance-mode.yml -K -i inventory.yml
#+end_src

Put everything into maintenance.
#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook maintenance-mode-all.yml -K -i inventory.yml
#+end_src

** Provision ERP
Provision ERP is a collection of ansibles roles to make easy the setup of multiples environments. Every environemnt is a distribution center, this approach makes us use the same code for all distribution centers and easy to maintain.

*** Running playbooks
#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook entry_point.yml -i inventory.yml -k -K
#+end_src

Entry point is the =main= playbook, this is going to ask for:
  - User name.
  - Environment (Sage300 SQL server name lowecase).
  - URL (DNS url for the application, Ex: erp.vertilux.com).
  - Port (SQL server port set on firewall rule).

*** Roles
- set-config-files
- append-nginx-config
- set-sidekiq-service
- logrotate

** Tower
A collections of playbooks to perform tasks with the tower web interface.
